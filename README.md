# 📚 Library Management System using Django

## A web-based system for librarians to manage books, members, issuing and returning of books.


## 📖 Project Description

The **Library Management System using Django** is a full-featured web application designed to help librarians efficiently manage books and members in a library. Built using the Django web framework, it allows administrators to perform core library tasks such as adding and updating books, registering members, issuing and returning books, and tracking rent fees and member debts.

This system streamlines library operations by integrating a rent calculation mechanism, ensuring that members who borrow books are charged based on the number of days the book is issued. It also enforces a debt limit, automatically preventing members from borrowing further if their outstanding dues exceed ₹500. Additionally, the application can fetch and import book data directly from an external API (Frappe Library API), making it easier to populate the system with valid book entries without manual input.

The app provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing day-to-day tasks and includes a search function for quickly locating books by title or author. It also includes an admin panel for backend data management. This project is ideal for small to mid-sized libraries and serves as a practical demonstration of Django’s power for building real-world web applications.
